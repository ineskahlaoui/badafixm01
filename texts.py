The start of this period was fixed to two years after the historical event for WW2 and 9/11, to allow a buffer for the film industry to respond to and reflect these events in cinema. For the Cold War, a mid-period range was selected to capture the ongoing sentiments during this prolonged era, while the control period of 1996-2001 offers a baseline against which to measure changes in emotional trends in cinema outside of these major historical contexts.""")

In the historical events, there is a clear pattern of emotions such as disappointment, fear, anger, sadness, annoyance, being frequent. Nevertheless, other emotions such as joy are also consistently present. Moreover, the control period did not exhibit a significant divergence from this pattern.
